/* npx is similar to the npm it means that executing the packaging 
to bring the react using the cdn link is not the good way for the production 
we will so using the package.jdon
we will install the react npm install react and then go for the npm install react dom and then for going to the sever
use the case of the npx parcel filename.html se we will go to the server
 her do not use the  cdn link to avoid the use of the cdn link we have use the install react but to bring those react in the js file we need to use the import react and import reactDom
 npx parcel  bundle index1.html then we will get the error as we are trying to change the entry point to our file 
 so we will change the main
 bundlers,parecle,parcle cache,git ignore */
