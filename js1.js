/**
 * Parcelâ€™s builtin dev server is automatically started when you run the default parcel command, which is a shortcut for parcel serve
 * HMR improves the development experience by updating modules in the browser at runtime without needing a whole page refresh.
 * CSS changes are automatically applied via HMR with no page reload necessary.
 *  If you restart the dev server, Parcel will only rebuild files that have changed since the last time it ran
